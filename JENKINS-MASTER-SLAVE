############################# JENKINS MASTER SLAVE ############################################
*we go master slave architecture in two situations
1.used for scaling jenkins that is by add more slaves(agent) jenkins run more jobs concurently
2.sometimes we have jobs thas has to be tested on different OS,this is achive using master/slave

***DEMO
*launch sever
*j dashboard - mjenkiins - Manage nodes and clouds - new node - name - Number of executors - 
 Remote root directory(/var/lib/jenkins) - labels(xyz) (labels are used to map jobs with that slave,supose lable(xyz) if run job in slave then we provide label as 'xyz')
 - launch method(launch agent via SSH) - host (slave instance private ip) - add new credientials - Host Key Verification Strategy(Non verifying Verification Strategy) - svae
*open slave instance
1.sudo yum install java-17-amazon-corretto-devel
2.sudo mkdir /opt/jenkins
3.ls -ltr /opt
4.sudo chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user /opt/jenkins (to change jenkins)
